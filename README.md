# 🟡 Four Wins - Connect Four Robot

**Four Wins** is an interactive **Connect Four** game where the user competes against an intelligent computer system.  
The system uses a **camera** to analyze the board state, calculates the optimal next move using the **Minimax algorithm**, and executes the move mechanically via a controller.  

This project combines **artificial intelligence**, **computer vision**, and **robotics** to create a fully interactive gaming experience.
